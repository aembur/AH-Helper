# AH Helper
A small, client-side 1.12.2 QoL mod for the Cosmic Craft server. The goal was to add a per item price to the Auction House tooltips. For example:

A stack of Golden Apples is listed for $180,000. Rather than having to whip out a calculator or do mental maths to find out the price for a single apple, this mod simply does the maths for you and adds it to the tooltip like this:

This also works with SellStick uses:

Tooltips for single items or single-use SellSticks will remain unchanged.
